# epigenetic-factor-TNBC
Assessing and prioritizing epigenetic factors in TNBC Patients 

Goal: Assess Epifactors specific to TNBC from patient cohort and prioritize for experimental validation in-inhouse TNBC models

Gene expression database and computational analysis
The METABRIC breast cancer dataset (EGAS000000000083) in cBioportal contains gene expression dataset of about 2000 samples performed on the Illumina HT-12 v3 platform (Curtis et al., 2012). In this cohort, tumor samples were assigned to three intrinsic subtypes (ER+HER2-, HER2+ and TNBC). Following which, expression of epigenetic-associated genes from EpiFactors database (http://epifactors.autosome.ru) were analyzed within the breast cancer subtypes (Medvedeva et al., 2015). Genes with FDR < 0.01 were then further analyzed for association to survival (p < 0.05). TNBC samples were grouped into TNBC molecular subtypes using TNBCtype (http://cbc.mc.vanderbilt.edu/tnbc/)
